## Missing Home: Demolitions in post-Katrina New Orleans

This is the code that gathers, builds and renders the page at http://projects.thelensnola.org/demolitions/. It includes a fair amount of code that is specific to this project, but the comments should alert you to those instances.

The project is powered by a "backend" of Google Docs and Sheets, and is served by S3.
